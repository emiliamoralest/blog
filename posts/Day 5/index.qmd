On the final day of the course, we had a session about the R package ggplot2, which is widely used for making graphs in R as there are a lot of options to personalize. Some useful links provided in the presentation:

- ggplot2 extensions <https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/>
- A curated list of awesome ggplot2 tutorials, packages etc. <https://github.com/erikgahner/awesome-ggplot2>
- Official cheatsheet <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/>
- RStudio cheatsheets, including Quarto and several useful packages <https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/>

After learning some theory behind ggplot2, the structure and some examples, we did some exercises ourselves by following a [tutorial](https://nbisweden.github.io/raukr-2023/labs/ggplot/) from NBIS. With this, we had a more basic exercise, and two more complex ones where we tried to recreate some public plots. Here are the resulting plots made by me:

![Heatmap](images/heatmap.png){width=70% fig-align="center"}
