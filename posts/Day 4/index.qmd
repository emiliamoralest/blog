Today we could run correctly the RNA-Seq pipeline with nextflow and nf-core. First, we tested the workflow manager nextflow by chaining the steps for qc and multiqc. Then we tested the 'rnaseq' pipeline by nf-core, which was built with nextflow. We used some of the RNA samples we had previously received, and ran the pipeline.
