This repository contains the code for the blog created by me during the course Applied Bioinformatics from the MedBioinfo program. It contains a post for each day, where I summarise what we did and what information is most important for me to retain and apply to my projects in the future. The blog can be visited [here](https://emiliamoralest.github.io/blog/). The blog is created with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and published with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
